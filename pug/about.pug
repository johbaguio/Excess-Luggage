                        |I’m a 28 year old web developer with a <i> Bachelor’s degree in Information and Communications Technology</i>. I recently earned my post - graduate units in programming at <i> Hack Your Future </i>where I was able to hone my skills in programming using HTML5, CSS, Sass, React, JavaScript, Node.js and MySQL. Throughout the entire program, I was able to create some applications/projects that helped me better the skills I have acquired in the entire program. You can jump off and see the projects I've made

                        |Aside from navigating the cyber world, I also love exploring different places in the world. I love immersing myself in the diversities found in the country’s structures, history, and culture. In every place I’ve set my foot into, I made sure to take a piece of that place with me. These fragments of memories are collectively known as my excess luggage . Hop on and take a peek inside! ✈
