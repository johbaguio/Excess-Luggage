                    |Paris is well known all around the world for this <b><em>tower of love.</em></b> Many have this as the number one item on their <em>bucket lists</em> - including me. The goal of being able to see it started to come into reality after I was given the opportunity to work in Europe. By the time I got my first salary was when I started saving up for Paris. It was choosing between shopping or sleeping, take aways or home cooked meals, and food cravings or fasting. Truly wasn't easy but as they say , <em>'Those worth having don't come easy'.</em> I wasn't ready to give up just yet. With pure determination and perseverance I was finally able to explore the City of Love!  <br><br>

                    |Bonjour, Paris! ♡ <br><br>
                p
                    |Paris is not only known for the being home to the famous <em>Eiffel Tower,Disneyland, Monalisa painting, and Moulin Rouge bar</em>, it is also known as the City of Fashion and Design so I made sure I wasn't missing out on this. So in my leather pants and shades, I strutted my way to the city center where my dreams await. Being the tourist as I was, I clicked on my camera as often as I blinked - on every corner and nook there is. Then the clock seemed to stop, everything else was a blur, everyone moved in slow motion... And there it was, the <b>majestic Eiffel Tower in all its beauty.</b> It may sound so cliché, but I felt tears running down my face - happy tears. I was ecstatic and yet I just stared at it, trying to memorize every detail and trying to take in everything as much as I could. Pumped up from seeing the Eiffel Tower, I continued on to my itinerary which I believe is perfectly detailed and informative since I took much of my free time making it. I went on to see the Louvre museum, Moulin Rouge, the Wall of Love, and Notre Dame. In between seeing these equally beautiful structures, I made sure to reenergize and stuff my tummy with French baguettes, macaroons, and my favorite croissants. <br><br>

                    |To say that Paris is packed by tourists is an understatement, it is <em>flooded by tourists.</em> It is no wonder why it is also the perfect avenue for criminals to trick, scam, or steal from these overwhelmed tourists so be extra vigilant.<br><br>
