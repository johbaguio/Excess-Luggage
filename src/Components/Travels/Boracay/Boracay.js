                    <p className='text-travels'>Boracay is a <b>world-renowned</b> favorite tourist destination for both local and international travelers. Some say it is <em>synonymous to the word paradise</em>, and I couldn't agree more. I have been in Boracay twice and I honestly couldn't get enough of it. Hotels and resorts are always fully booked especially during holidays and everywhere you go, people are just everywhere. Being the top tourist destination, one could really maximize one's stay in Boracay since it is both for families and friends. The kids have a wide variety of options for activities such as parasailing, banana boat, flyfish, aquanaut, among others. There are options of exploring the entire island by booking an island tour where you could visit other sights such as the Puka Beach and Crystal Cove which is the exact opposite of the serene beachfront because here you could see waves hit fast from a cliff. </p>

                    <p className='text-travels'>One of the highlights of a Boracay trip is to ride aboard a boat called <b>Paraw.</b> <b>Parawsailing</b> is the <em>best way to chase the sunset</em>, you are being lulled in netted hammocks while watching the sun set. But if you prefer staying offshore, you could also have a massage on a mat on a sand by the beach! What a perfect way to relax your night away. </p>

                    <p className='text-travels'>There are many options for dining as well, depending on your taste. When the night falls, it means that the party has just started. Most establishments have different entertainment ready and the most common is <em>fire dancing.</em> It's a very mesmerizing sight to behold, the contrast of the fire sizzling against the night sky. The dancers are well trained to be interactive as well. They encourage diners to have a fiery experience but with their close supervision. All establishments have clubs that host parties every night, making sure every one gets an unforgettable night. It's one of a kind experience to have club hopping by the beach, barefoot and sandy.</p>

                    <p className='text-travels'>What makes Boracay distinct amongst others is its <b><em>fine white sand beach and pristine blue waters.</em></b> Even without all the other factors that add to it, you would just fall in love with how much of a stunner this place is. <em>I have been to a lot of beaches, but <em>nothing can compare to the beauty of Boracay.</em> I would always be coming back for more.</em></p>
