                    <img src="https://s19.postimg.cc/7330eddjn/surfing.jpg" alt="Surfing the waves in Siargao" className="siargao-pics" />                                      
                    <p class="left-content">If you were to ask me 10 years ago if I wanted to go surfing, I would definitely say <b>no.</b> No, simply because <em>I don't know how to swim.</em> I know, I live in an archipelago, I grew up with the beach just 10 minutes away by foot, and I have easy access to different bodies of water. BUT NO, I still don't know how. I may not know how, but it wouldn't be of much use to me anyway, right? Siargao has recently been the talk of town. It got featured in a movie that showcases its beauty, so every one wanted to see for themselves. I wouldn't miss it for the world, either. So I booked a ticket and prepared myself for a wavy ride, come what may! </p>
                    <p class="left-content">Siargao is a small island at the southern part of the Philippines which has been a favorite amongst tourists, especially surfers as it is a common venue for international surfing competitions. Upon arrival, I already felt the <em>"homey feels"</em> of the island, my gut feel tells me that it's going to be a good time. As I planned, my first day would be to take it slow as I would familiarize the island. I was very lucky to be able to book at a resort that was very near the famous Cloud 9 which is divided into 2 - the beginners' area and the professionals' area. </p>
                    <img src="https://s19.postimg.cc/z373yn1kj/cloud9.jpg" alt="Cloud 9 siargao" className="siargao-pics" />                                                        
                    <p class="left-content">The Cloud 9 is a long wooden structure that serves as a bridge from the shoreline to the cottage-like building which is the viewing area for the professionals' area. Walking along the shoreline, the locals approached me and asked so kindly if I wanted to have surfing lessons with them which I politely declined fearing that I might get some unwanted injuries that might complicate my vacation. From my spot, I saw <b>locals-turned-surf instructors</b> teaching tourists how to surf which was a very refreshing sight to see. I spent the entire afternoon staring out into the vastness of the sea, listening to the waves crashing with my coconut drink. Being a small town, it was easy to choose were to dine and spend the night away since restobars take turns in having their schedule every day of the week. So there is a big possibility of bumping into the same crowd every night for the entire duration of my stay. Their kind of night parties here are mostly composed of <em>laid-back vibes</em>, so chill. This is really the place to be if you want a vacation that would give you the ultimate island vibe experience. </p> 
                                    
                    <p class="left-content">The second day started early because I booked as a joiner in an island hopping tour package. As part of the tour, we visited nearby islands - Daku, Naked, and Guyam Islands.</p>

                        <p class="left-content">Daku Island is the most shaded island with coconut trees yet the most commercialized also among the three since it had cottages for rental and stores where you could buy seafood and have it cooked the way you wanted it to be, Naked Island got its name because it looked like a sandbar with not a single tree and infrastructure on it, Guyam Island had a rocky terrain on one side but still has the fine sand shoreline on the other. There are activities offered on both Daku and Guyam islands like snorkeling, jet skiing, or just simply swimming. As part of the side trip, we visited Bucas Grande, an hour boat ride against the biggest waves I've seen in my entire life that made me hang on to my life vest tightly, they have 3 activities - going inside the Sohoton cove, cliff diving, and paddling across the jellyfish sanctuary. </p>

                    <p class="left-content">The third day was just as jam-packed, still a joiner with the same tour company, we were scheduled to go to Magpupungko tidal pools, and Sugba Lagoon. Both have picturesque scenes that were truly 'IG-worthy'. After such an eventful 3 day stay, now I am down to my last day which means <b><em>IT'S SURF TIME!</em></b> Making sure I had my best swimwear on, I went to Cloud 9 to search for my surfing instructor. There I was able to find myself 2 locals who taught me basic steps on how to surf, and who took photos of me while I was trying to surf. I was taught the <em>3-step basic surfing: 1 -face down, legs apart, toes pushing upward position ( the ready position), 2 - pushing yourself up, and putting your feet forward ( the standing position), 3 - placing the remaining foot behind the first one while trying to balance ( the surfing position ).</em> After I have mastered the steps, we headed to the area of beginners and surprisingly, the water level was just around my waist but boy, the waves were just mighty ones. While I was mentally remembering the steps we learned, I heard my instructor say that a wave is coming and that I should be prepared. Then, the wave came, following the steps I was able to keep my balance quite long for a first - timer. It was just <em>addicting!</em> I wanted to catch wave after wave regardless if I am able to successfully stand on both feet and stay or not. <b>Time, indeed, flies by so fast when you're having fun.</b> Before I knew it, time's up! one hour was over and I can't believe I'm sad it did. Who would have thought I would enjoy it as much as I did?!This trip was such an eye opener for me to push myself beyond limits.
